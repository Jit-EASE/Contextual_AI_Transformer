1,Food Vision 2030 Summary,"Food Vision 2030 outlines Ireland's long-term agri-food strategy centred on sustainability, value-add, climate action, and market diversification. Key targets include a 10% reduction in biogenic methane by 2030, improved water quality, biodiversity enhancement, and increased farmer income resilience. The strategy emphasises grass-based systems, digitalisation, data-driven farming, and alignment with EU Green Deal and Farm-to-Fork directives."
2,CAP Strategic Plan 2023–2027,"Ireland's CAP Strategic Plan consists of Pillar I direct payments and Pillar II eco-schemes, agri-environment programmes, and farm investment support. Conditionality includes GAEC standards, nutrient management, animal welfare rules, and carbon efficiency practices. Dairy and beef farms are expected to adopt low-emission slurry spreading, improve nitrogen-use efficiency, and follow ACRES/eco-scheme actions such as hedgerow management, soil testing, and multispecies swards."
3,Nitrates Directive and Derogation Rules,"Ireland applies the Nitrates Directive with stricter banding from 2024 due to water-quality trends. Derogation stocking limits were reduced from 250 kg N/ha to 220 kg N/ha in certain catchments. Farmers must implement nutrient management planning, slurry storage requirements, protected urea adoption, and fenced watercourses. High-stocked dairy farms face the largest compliance costs and management pressure."
4,ACRES Scheme Overview,"ACRES (Agri-Climate Rural Environment Scheme) provides payments for landscape management, biodiversity enhancement, water-quality actions, and carbon-friendly farming. There are two pathways: ACRES General and ACRES Co-operation (targeting priority landscapes). Actions include riparian buffers, low-input grassland maintenance, winter bird food, tree planting, and peatland restoration. Participation has significant implications for farm income stability and environmental delivery."
5,Teagasc Grass Growth & PastureBase Findings,"Teagasc reports highlight that grass growth variability is primarily influenced by rainfall distribution, soil temperature, and nitrogen availability. PastureBase Ireland data shows increasing variability in spring and late-summer growth under climate shifts. Multi-species swards and clover reduce fertiliser costs and increase drought resilience. Grass deficits negatively affect milk solids output and require supplementary feeding."
6,Irish Dairy Sector Overview,"Grass-based dairy farms in Ireland show strong cost competitiveness but increasing exposure to weather volatility, input-price shocks, and carbon constraints. Key risks include rainfall deficits, fodder shortages, fertiliser price spikes, and regulatory tightening under the Nitrates Directive. Medium-term opportunities include methane-reducing feed additives, digital pasture measurement, genetics for efficiency, and expanded EU market access."
7,Beef Sector Summary,"Beef farms depend heavily on CAP payments and face low market margins. Policy pressure is rising over emissions intensity, land-use competition, and biodiversity commitments. Improved profitability relies on genetics, weight-gain efficiency, reduced methane, better grassland management, and adoption of low-carbon practices. Diversification into forestry and organics is encouraged by CAP Pillar II."
8,Tillage Sector Summary,"Tillage farms benefit from lower emissions intensity and strong rotational value. Risks include wet harvests, disease pressure, and input-price swings. CAP supports protein crops, eco-schemes, cover crops, and minimum tillage. Opportunities arise from feed self-sufficiency, renewable energy crops, and expanding Ireland's native grain sector."
9,Sheep Sector Summary,"Sheep farms face income volatility and climate exposure. Supports include ACRES, knowledge-transfer groups, animal health improvements, and hill-farming measures. Weather shocks and fodder pressure remain major risks. Genetic improvement and pasture management are central to long-term viability."
10,Climate and Emissions Policy,"Ireland’s Climate Act mandates 25% emissions reduction for agriculture by 2030. Teagasc MACC identifies measures such as feed additives, multi-species swards, protected urea, improved genetics, slurry management, and optimised fertiliser timing. Implementation requires capital investment, advisory support, and digital nutrient monitoring."
11,Water Quality Policy (EPA Summary),"EPA findings show that nutrient losses from agriculture remain the dominant pressure on rivers and estuaries. Priority actions include buffer zones, reduced chemical nitrogen, better slurry timing, and catchment-based interventions. Compliance intensity differs across counties, especially in high dairy-density regions."
12,Rainfall and Weather Risk in Irish Agriculture,"Irish agriculture is highly exposed to rainfall extremes. Deficits reduce grass growth and require supplementation; surpluses increase runoff, waterlogging, and reduce grazing days. Climate models project increased rainfall variability with more frequent summer deficits and intense winter rainfall events affecting soil structure and slurry spreading windows."
13,Digitalisation and Agri-Tech Adoption,"Digital farming adoption is accelerating through sensors, NDVI, remote sensing, farm management software, and decision-support tools. Key barriers include cost, broadband quality, and training. CAP and EU Digital Strategy support farm data infrastructure, interoperability, and AI-enabled advisory systems."
14,Irish Agri-Food Market Trends,"Milk price volatility has increased due to global supply–demand cycles, Chinese demand shifts, and energy price fluctuations. Beef markets remain relatively flat with premium opportunities in sustainability-certified segments. Tillage margins depend heavily on global grain markets and input prices. Risk management tools such as forward contracts and co-op hedging products remain underutilised."
15,Farm Income & Resilience,"Teagasc National Farm Survey indicates rising input costs, labour shortages, regulatory pressure, and climate obligations. Income resilience improves through diversification, efficiency, environmental payments, and digital tools. Policy emphasis is shifting toward reward-based environmental delivery rather than pure volume output."
